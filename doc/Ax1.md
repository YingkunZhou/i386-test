# M1 Exploration - v 0.70

This remains a preliminary version.
Everything up to L1 cache discussion I am fairly confident of, having had some time to perform experiments, read the patents carefully, and edit the writing.
The L1 cache discussion and everything subsequent is a lot more tentative.
Poorly/ not yet edited, no experiments performed (or I’m unhappy with some of the experiments because I keep thinking of new ways to interpret the results so they’re not definitive).
Many of the patents I refer to I think I have the essential ideas correct, but that’s the result of a quick scan and analysis, not a thorough reading or a tracking down of all the related patents.
Even so, pretty soon the A15 and its companion chips (M2?)
will be out, and people will want to start exploring those.
Hopefully with this as vade mecum, they can spend more time getting to fundamental analysis and truly understanding what’s new, and less time re-inventing the wheel.
This is a CC0 1.0 Universal document meaning you can do what you like with it, you don’t need my permission.
It’s your choice as to whether, given that freedom, you behave like a decent human being or like a dick.
You want to pretend my words or investigations are yours go ahead -- but nothing stays secret for long on the internet.
If someone concludes they really want to translate this, go ahead, you don’t need my permission.
We’re all in this together, trying to understand.
However I’m exhausted and others probably also have good ideas.
I hope others can contribute, so we can continue the great work.
I will keep updating this and maybe publishing new updates every month or so.
Who knows when it will be done?
When I started I had no idea it would become such a deep dive, or that so much could be (somewhat reliably) established.
